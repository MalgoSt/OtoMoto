The work is divided into two parts:
- OtoMoto1_WebScrapping.ipynb
- OtoMoto2_PricePreparation.ipynb

<b>Purpose:</b>
Building a model to predict car prices and classify prices as overstated, understated or average.
Data from the OtoMoto.pl website obtained by webscrapping will be used to learn the model. The source code, that was used to retrieve the data, is in the notebook: OtoMoto - WebScrapping.ipynb.
